# VR House
The idea of â€‹â€‹this project was to create a replica of a house that could send and receive information from a VR game in real time through Firebase requests. The replica of the house was modeled and inserted into a 3d map, the furniture was also modeled and scaled allowing visualization within the game. Inputs were placed so that the player could interact with the doors and lighting, sending requests to Firebase through the code in Unity
